          <p>My name is Nomin (Nomie) Ganbayar and I am a digital media artist based in Oakland, California. I am currently a
          transfer student at San Jose State University, working towards a BFA in Digital Media Art. I have always found solace in
          creating art as a child, working and experimenting with different mediums. As I grew older, I found that using the
          digital space as my canvas is where I am able to express my creativity to the fullest.
          
          In my artworks, I often explore moments in my personal life and spiritual journey as well as dipping my toes into the
          unknown, I seek to capture the essence of experiences through a unique fusion of technology and artistic expression.
          
          Growing up with a strong connection to my Mongolian heritage and cultural background, I aim to represent both my culture
          and myself in my art. My pieces often include references and odes to my cultural roots, weaving elements of Mongolian
          history and spirituality into my pieces. I draw inspiration from my love for science fiction, fantasy, spirituality, and
          philosophy and meld these genres to create a unique visual language that speaks to my experiences and how I perceive
          life.
          
          Ultimately, I seek to create a space for reflection and contemplation, inviting others to delve into the deeper meanings
          behind each piece. By experimenting with and learning different mediums and technologies, I aim to push the boundaries
          of the digital space by creating immersive, thought-provoking pieces that speak to the soul. Whether through a single
          piece or a larger body of work, I hope to inspire others to explore their personal journeys and to use art as a tool to
          help us make sense of the world around us. <a href="resume.html"> resume</a>. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
